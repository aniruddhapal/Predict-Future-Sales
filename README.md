# Predict-Future-Sales
Predict total sales for every product and store in the next month.

# Introduction

## Why This Project?
This project is part of the "How to Win a Data Science Competition" Coursera course, and it presents a real-world challenge of predicting sales for one of Russia's largest software firms, 1C Company. Accurate sales forecasting is a critical aspect of retail operations, helping businesses optimize inventory, reduce overstock and understock situations, and improve customer satisfaction. The ability to predict future sales empowers businesses to plan better, minimize wastage, and maximize profits.

In this competition, we are tasked with forecasting the total sales for each product in every store for the upcoming month. Given the dynamic nature of product availability, pricing fluctuations, and store-specific trends, this problem mirrors the complex forecasting issues faced by retail companies worldwide.

## Real-Life Problem Solved
Sales forecasting is a fundamental problem for any retail chain, as it directly impacts supply chain management, operational efficiency, and profitability. Retailers need to handle large volumes of sales data across numerous stores and products, all while accounting for seasonal variations, promotional periods, and demand fluctuations. By developing a robust forecasting model, companies can ensure they maintain optimal stock levels, reducing the costs associated with both overstock and stockouts. The insights gained from this model can be extended to other industries reliant on accurate demand prediction, such as manufacturing, e-commerce, and supply chain management.

## Strategies to Solve the Problem
### Feature Engineering:
A key part of this project involves creating meaningful features from historical sales data, such as monthly sales aggregates, lag-based features (e.g., previous month sales), and price trends. We will also explore combining supplemental data such as item categories and shop information to enrich our predictions.

### Handling Time Series Data:
Since the dataset consists of daily sales data from January 2013 to October 2015, we need to model temporal dependencies effectively. Strategies such as using rolling windows or lag features will help capture past trends, while features like the `date_block_num` will be used to track time progression.

### Dealing with Data Sparsity:
In real-world retail settings, not every product is sold in every shop every month. This leads to sparse data, which can introduce noise into predictions. Techniques like data aggregation and missing data imputation will help mitigate these challenges.

## Modeling Approach:
For this problem, we will experiment with both traditional machine learning models and advanced algorithms. Some potential models include:

- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: XGBoost or LightGBM, which are well-suited for tabular data and can handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Neural Networks for Time Series**: Potentially exploring recurrent neural networks (RNN) or LSTMs to capture time dependencies in the sales data.
- **Ensembling**: Combining predictions from multiple models to create a more accurate and robust forecast.

## Evaluation Metric:
The competition uses Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, which penalizes larger errors more heavily. As the target values are clipped between 0 and 20, our model needs to focus on predicting values within this range accurately, avoiding extreme predictions.

## Roadmap to Success:
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) will help uncover key patterns in the data. Handling missing values, outliers, and understanding the distribution of target variables will form the foundation of the project.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating time-related features, capturing shop and item-level characteristics, and analyzing sales trends over time will be the core strategies to improve model performance.
3. **Modeling and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and leveraging cross-validation techniques will be crucial for model improvement.
4. **Final Submission**: We will predict the monthly sales for November 2015, ensuring the submission file follows the required format: `ID, item_cnt_month`.
